                <h1>5.1 - Analyse strategies in teaching and learning for effective engagement with EAL learners</h2>
                    <p>Effective engagement with learners who speak English as an additional language (EAL) requires a
                        deliberate, inclusive,
                        and structured pedagogical approach. In computing education, this challenge is heightened by the
                        use of specialist
                        terminology, abstract concepts, and syntax-based languages that rely heavily on precise meaning.
                        Without appropriate
                        support, EAL learners may understand concepts but struggle to articulate understanding or engage
                        confidently in
                        discussions and assessments.
                    </p>

                    <p>To address this, I employ scaffolding strategies that reduce linguistic barriers while
                        maintaining academic and
                        technical rigour. This includes breaking instructions into clear stages, modelling expected
                        outcomes, and using visual
                        representations such as flowcharts, wireframes, diagrams, and annotated code examples. These
                        approaches align with
                        Vygotsky’s concept of the Zone of Proximal Development, where structured support enables
                        learners to progress beyond
                        their current level of independent performance (Vygotsky, 1978).</p>

                    <p>Collaborative learning also plays a key role. Pair and group activities allow EAL learners to
                        engage in peer dialogue,
                        rehearse technical vocabulary, and build confidence in a low-pressure environment. Practical,
                        task-based learning is
                        particularly effective in computing, as learners can demonstrate understanding through
                        functionality and problem-solving
                        rather than language alone. Over time, this approach supports both subject mastery and language
                        development, enabling
                        EAL learners to participate more fully and confidently in learning and assessment.</p>

                <h1>5.2 - Summarise strategies for teaching and learning for young people and adults who are adapting to
                    life in the UK</h2>
                    <p>Learners adapting to life in the UK often face a combination of academic, linguistic, cultural,
                        and social challenges.
                        These learners may be unfamiliar with the UK education system, assessment expectations, and
                        classroom norms, which can
                        affect confidence, engagement, and progression. In technical subjects such as computing, this
                        adjustment period can be
                        particularly demanding.
                    </p>

                    <p>To support these learners effectively, teaching must be explicit, structured, and culturally
                        responsive. I ensure that
                        expectations around assessment criteria, academic integrity, group work, and professional
                        conduct are clearly explained
                        and reinforced. This transparency supports learners in navigating unfamiliar systems and reduces
                        anxiety associated with
                        hidden expectations.</p>

                    <p>Culturally responsive teaching also involves recognising and valuing learners’ prior experiences
                        and skills. Many
                        learners adapting to life in the UK bring valuable perspectives, resilience, and problem-solving
                        approaches shaped by
                        different educational and cultural contexts. By incorporating discussion, reflection, and
                        collaborative activities, I
                        create opportunities for learners to share experiences and build a sense of belonging within the
                        classroom. This
                        inclusive approach supports engagement, motivation, and retention, while helping learners
                        develop the confidence
                        required to progress academically and professionally.</p>

                <h1>5.3 - Summarise implications of trauma-informed practice for teaching and learning</h2>
                    <p>Trauma-informed practice recognises that learners may have experienced adverse events that affect
                        emotional regulation,
                        concentration, memory, and engagement. Trauma does not always present visibly and may manifest
                        as inconsistent
                        attendance, withdrawal, difficulty meeting deadlines, or heightened anxiety. In computing
                        education, where sustained
                        focus and problem-solving are required, these impacts can significantly affect learning.</p>

                    <p>Applying trauma-informed principles involves creating predictable, supportive learning
                        environments that prioritise
                        emotional safety alongside academic challenge. Clear routines, consistent communication, and
                        structured lessons help
                        reduce cognitive and emotional load. Providing choices in learning activities and assessment
                        methods allows learners to
                        demonstrate achievement in ways that feel manageable and supportive.</p>

                    <p>Importantly, trauma-informed practice does not lower expectations but instead removes unnecessary
                        barriers to learning.
                        By responding with empathy, flexibility, and clarity, teaching supports learners to re-engage
                        with learning and build
                        confidence over time. This approach aligns with inclusive professional practice and contributes
                        to improved retention,
                        achievement, and wellbeing (Brunzell et al., 2016).</p>
