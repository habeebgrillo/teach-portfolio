                <h1>6.1 - Explain ways in which theories, principles, and models of learning can be applied to teaching,
                    learning, and assessment
                    for all learners</h2>
                    <p>Effective teaching practice is informed by a combination of learning theories rather than
                        reliance on a single model. In
                        computing education, this blended approach is particularly important due to the balance between
                        skill acquisition,
                        conceptual understanding, and applied problem-solving.
                    </p>

                    <p>Behaviourist principles support the development of foundational technical skills through
                        repetition, immediate feedback,
                        and practice, such as learning syntax, debugging code, or using development tools.
                        Constructivist approaches, informed
                        by Vygotsky (1978), support deeper understanding through problem-based learning, collaborative
                        projects, and real-world
                        scenarios where learners construct knowledge through experience. Humanistic approaches emphasise
                        motivation,
                        self-efficacy, and learner autonomy, supporting engagement and persistence in challenging
                        technical subjects.</p>

                    <p>Assessment strategies reflect this blended approach. Formative assessment, peer feedback, and
                        reflective evaluation
                        support learning as a process rather than a one-off outcome. Summative assessment is designed to
                        reflect
                        industry-relevant tasks, such as developing functional applications or evaluating design
                        decisions, ensuring alignment
                        between theory, practice, and professional standards.</p>

                <h1>6.3 - Analyse models of learning preferences</h2>
                    <p>Models of learning preferences, such as VARK and Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory, provide
                        useful frameworks for
                        designing inclusive learning experiences, provided they are applied critically rather than
                        prescriptively. While
                        learners should not be labelled or restricted by perceived preferences, awareness of varied
                        learning approaches supports
                        inclusive planning (Coffield et al., 2004).
                    </p>

                    <p>Kolb’s experiential learning cycle is particularly relevant to computing and software engineering
                        education. Learners
                        engage in concrete experience through practical tasks, reflect on outcomes, conceptualise
                        learning through discussion
                        and theory, and actively experiment by refining solutions (Kolb, 1984). This cyclical process
                        mirrors professional
                        software development and supports deeper learning through iteration and reflection.</p>

                    <p>By offering varied activities such as demonstrations, hands-on practice, discussion, and
                        reflection, teaching accommodates diverse preferences while ensuring all learners develop a full
                        range of cognitive and practical skills.</p>

                <h1>6.4 - Describe the impact of neuroscience for effective planning, teaching, delivery, and assessment
                    </h2>
                    <p>Advances in neuroscience have influenced understanding of how learners process, retain, and
                        retrieve information.
                        Concepts such as cognitive load theory highlight the importance of managing the amount of
                        information presented at any
                        one time, particularly in subjects involving complex problem-solving (Sweller, 1988).</p>
                    <p>In response, I design lessons that break complex concepts into smaller components, revisit key
                        ideas regularly, and
                        provide opportunities for retrieval practice. In computing, this might involve revisiting core
                        programming concepts
                        across multiple projects rather than teaching them in isolation. Assessment design also reflects
                        these principles,
                        allowing learners to demonstrate understanding progressively rather than relying solely on
                        high-stakes testing.</p>
                    <p>Understanding the role of memory and emotion in learning reinforces the importance of supportive
                        learning environments.
                        Learners are more likely to retain and apply knowledge when they feel confident, supported, and
                        cognitively challenged
                        at an appropriate level.</p>

                <h1>6.5 - Explain how evidence-informed inclusive teaching, learning, and assessment strategies enable
                    inclusive teaching,
                    learning, and assessment
                    </h2>
                    <p>Evidence-informed practice ensures that teaching strategies are grounded in research rather than
                        assumption. Inclusive
                        planning frameworks such as Universal Design for Learning (UDL) support this approach by
                        encouraging multiple means of
                        engagement, representation, and expression (CAST, 2018).
                    </p>
                    <p>In practice, this involves offering varied learning resources, flexible assessment methods, and
                        opportunities for
                        learner choice. Differentiation is achieved through task design rather than separate activities,
                        ensuring all learners
                        work towards shared outcomes while accessing learning at an appropriate level of challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>Formative assessment is central to inclusive planning, enabling timely feedback, adjustment of
                        teaching strategies, and
                        responsive support. This approach ensures that planning remains dynamic and learner-centred,
                        supporting achievement and
                        progression for all learners.</p>

                <h1>6.8 - Explain ways in which theories and models of curriculum development can be applied when
                    developing curricula
                    </h2>
                    <p>Curriculum development models provide structured frameworks for designing coherent and relevant
                        programmes of study.
                        Tyler’s Rationale emphasises clear objectives, aligned content, and appropriate assessment,
                        ensuring curriculum design
                        remains purposeful and outcomes-focused (Tyler, 1949). Taba’s Model extends this by advocating a
                        more inductive,
                        teacher-led approach that responds to learner needs and contextual factors.</p>
                    <p>In computing education, these models support curriculum design that balances technical knowledge,
                        practical application,
                        and employability skills. Curriculum content is sequenced to build progressively from
                        foundational concepts to applied,
                        industry-relevant projects. Assessment strategies are aligned with professional practice,
                        ensuring learners are prepared
                        for progression into employment or further study.
                    </p>
                    <p>Applying curriculum theory in this way ensures that programmes remain inclusive, coherent, and
                        responsive to both
                        learner needs and industry expectations.
