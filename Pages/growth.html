                    <p>
                        This section presents a reflective account of my professional growth as a computing lecturer,
                        demonstrating
                        how reflective models, continuous professional development, and educational research inform and
                        improve my
                        teaching practice. The discussion integrates theory with practical examples and personal
                        insight,
                        supported
                        by academic research and evidence-based decision-making.

                <!-- ===================== 7.1 ===================== -->
                <section id="lo7-1">
                    <h2>7.1 Describe theories and models of reflection to evaluate the effectiveness of teacher practice
                        in
                        planning
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        Reflective practice is a fundamental process through which teachers evaluate the effectiveness
                        of
                        their
                        planning and delivery in order to improve future practice. One widely recognised model is
                        <strong>Gibbs’
                            Reflective Cycle</strong> (1988), which provides a structured framework consisting of
                        description,
                        feelings,
                        evaluation, analysis, conclusion, and action planning. This model encourages systematic
                        reflection
                        by
                        guiding
                        teachers to consider not only what happened during a lesson, but why it happened and how future
                        practice can
                        be improved.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I regularly use Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle after delivering lessons to evaluate whether learning
                        objectives
                        were met, how learners engaged with activities, and where misconceptions arose. The final stages
                        of
                        the
                        cycle, particularly conclusion and action planning, directly inform my lesson planning by
                        highlighting
                        specific changes needed in sequencing, pacing, or differentiation for subsequent sessions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to Gibbs, <strong>Schön’s concepts of Reflection-on-Action and
                            Reflection-in-Action</strong>
                        (1983) play a significant role in my practice. Reflection-on-Action occurs after teaching and
                        allows
                        for
                        critical review of planning decisions, while Reflection-in-Action takes place during teaching,
                        enabling
                        real-time adjustments to explanations, activities, or support strategies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, during practical computing lessons, I may recognise through Reflection-in-Action
                        that
                        learners
                        are struggling with a particular coding concept. This prompts immediate scaffolding or
                        alternative
                        explanations, while Reflection-on-Action later informs how I redesign future lesson plans to
                        address
                        the
                        issue more effectively. Through the use of these reflective models, lesson planning becomes a
                        responsive and
                        evidence-informed process rather than a fixed sequence of activities.

                <section id="lo7-2">
                    <h2>7.2 Explain how teachers can develop and update knowledge in their own area of specialism</h2>

                    <p>
                        Continuous Professional Development (CPD) is essential for maintaining effective teaching
                        practice,
                        particularly within rapidly evolving subject areas such as computing. Teachers must engage in
                        ongoing CPD
                        to remain current in both their <strong>subject specialism</strong> and <strong>pedagogical
                            practice</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Developing Knowledge in Subject Specialism</h3>
                    <p>
                        In computing education, subject knowledge must reflect current industry practices and
                        technological
                        developments. I maintain subject currency by engaging with awarding body updates for BTEC and T
                        Level
                        provision, reviewing specification changes, and aligning lesson content with industry
                        expectations.
                        This
                        ensures that learners develop relevant, up-to-date skills that support progression into
                        employment
                        or
                        further study.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, I regularly explore new software tools, programming approaches, and digital
                        platforms
                        to
                        enhance curriculum relevance. This subject-specific CPD enables me to contextualise learning
                        using
                        authentic
                        examples, supporting learner motivation and employability.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Developing Pedagogical Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>
                        Alongside subject expertise, pedagogical CPD is critical to effective teaching. I engage with
                        educational
                        research related to inclusive practice, assessment strategies, and learner engagement. This
                        includes
                        developing strategies for differentiation, adaptive teaching, and the use of multimedia
                        resources to
                        support diverse learning needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Collaboration with Student Support Assistants (SSAs) also forms an important part of my
                        pedagogical
                        development. SSAs provide targeted support for learners with Education, Health and Care Plans
                        (EHCPs) and
                        those experiencing additional barriers to learning. Working alongside SSAs informs my planning
                        and
                        delivery,
                        ensuring that lessons are accessible while maintaining high expectations for all learners.

                    <h2>7.3 Critically review and apply educational research to develop evidence-based practice</h2>

                    <p>
                        Educational research plays a crucial role in shaping effective pedagogical and assessment
                        practices.
                        Evidence-based teaching ensures that decisions are grounded in proven strategies rather than
                        assumption or
                        habit. Research into formative assessment, particularly the work of <strong>Black and Wiliam
                            (1998)</strong>,
                        highlights the importance of ongoing feedback, questioning, and learner self-assessment in
                        improving
                        achievement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Engagement with this research directly influenced changes in my own practice. Rather than
                        relying
                        solely on
                        summative assessment, I introduced regular low-stakes questioning, retrieval activities, and
                        formative
                        checks for understanding. These strategies allow misconceptions to be identified early and
                        addressed
                        through targeted intervention.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Research into cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988) has also informed my lesson design,
                        particularly
                        in
                        technical subjects. By reducing unnecessary complexity and sequencing content into manageable
                        stages, I
                        support learners in developing secure foundational knowledge before progressing to more advanced
                        concepts.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A practical example of applying research to practice is the development of multimedia learning
                        resources,
                        including instructional videos. Research suggests that combining visual and auditory
                        explanations
                        can
                        enhance understanding when designed carefully. Producing such resources has improved learner
                        confidence,
                        supported independent study, and enabled learners to revisit complex topics at their own pace.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through critical engagement with educational research, I continually refine my teaching,
                        assessment,
                        and
                        support strategies. This reflective and evidence-based approach ensures that my professional
                        practice
                        remains effective, inclusive, and responsive to learner needs.
